# do-nothing

A professional CLI tool that simulates a complete system installation process but does absolutely nothing. Watch as it performs BIOS updates, loads kernel modules, installs drivers, scans WiFi networks, mounts filesystems, and installs packages - all without actually doing anything at all.

## Inspired By

[install-nothing](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/install-nothing) - A Rust-based CLI simulator
